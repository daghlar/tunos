## Update Mechanisms

### A/B Partitioning
The update system uses A/B partitioning. Updates are always applied to the inactive partition. After a successful update, the system switches to the updated partition.

### Cryptographically Signed Update Packages
All update packages are cryptographically signed. The kernel verifies the signature before applying any update.

### Integrity and Rollback Protection
The update process includes integrity checks using SHA-256. Rollback protection is enforced to prevent downgrading to previous insecure versions.

### GPG-Based Verification
Update signatures are verified using GPG. Only updates signed with trusted keys are accepted.

### Changelog Notification
After each update, the user is notified of the changelog using a secure notification script.

### OTA Pipeline
OTA updates are delivered through a secure pipeline. CI/CD integration ensures updates are tested before deployment.
