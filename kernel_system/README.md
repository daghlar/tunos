# Kernel and System Level

This module provides the core system and kernel-level security enhancements for TUNOS. Each component is implemented in strict English with no code comments.

## Security Mechanisms

### Control Flow Integrity (CFI)
Ensures that all control flow transfers in kernel space are valid. Prevents arbitrary code execution by enforcing strict control over function pointers and indirect branches. Only processes with non-root user IDs are allowed to pass CFI enforcement.

### No-Execute (NX) Memory Protection
Marks all memory pages as non-executable unless explicitly required. This prevents the execution of injected code in writable memory regions across the entire address space.

### Stack Smashing Protection (SSP)
Initializes a random guard value at kernel boot to detect and prevent stack buffer overflows. The guard is checked on function return to ensure stack integrity.

### Stack Canary
Generates a unique random value at initialization and places it on the stack. Any modification to this value indicates a stack overflow, and the kernel will terminate the affected process.

### SELinux Policy
Defines strict access controls and process domains for all kernel and user-space processes. SELinux is enabled by default and restricts capabilities for all non-system binaries.

### Seccomp Policy
Implements syscall filtering using a strict allowlist. Only essential syscalls are permitted for user-space applications, reducing the attack surface.

### Verified Boot (AVB)
Enforces Android Verified Boot version 2.0 with SHA256_RSA2048. Only signed and verified images can be loaded at boot. Rollback protection is enabled.

### Kernel Configuration
All kernel configuration options are set for maximum security. Stack protector, address space randomization, module signature enforcement, and strict memory protections are enabled.

### Verity
Implements block-level integrity checking using SHA256. Ensures that all system partitions are read-only and any modification is detected at boot.

All code and configuration in this module is in English and contains no comments.
